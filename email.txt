    Sample laravel Task .
    1) Install fresh laravel project .
    2) Activate default laravel login/register system.
    3) After login create sample dashboard .
    4) Add button to menu bar ,to add a blog button "Add Blog" 
    5) Add Blog button will open a new page with form having fields : 

    5.1) Title : atleast 30 charaters but Should not exceed more than 100 characters and contain atleast one alpha numeric character 
    5.2) Description : Must be between 100 - 250 characters 
    5.3) Text : a long text

    6) Please create proper migrations for above and store image in public folder and name in db,  Please use eloquent for any DB interaction / Use models 
    7) List all blogs created by user in dashboard in proper bootstrap layouts , show your creativity to show them but it should be responsive and using proper grids. User can have many blogs , so get it by Model relationships .​
